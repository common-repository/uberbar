All links to important pages on uberspace.de in one handy admin bar menu.

== Description ==

If your site is hosted on [uberspace.de](https://uberspace.de/), this plugin is for you.
It adds a menu to the admin bar containing links to the most important pages you might need regularly:

* Uberspace Dashboard
* Documentation Wiki
* Email Support - a click opens your email software with your user and server name in the mail body.
* Adminer and phpMyAdmin
* Webmail
* Webalizer
* Twitter account

The menu is visible for (network) administrators only.
The plugin requires at least **PHP 5.4**. You will get an error during
installation if you are still using an older PHP version.
[Update PHP](https://wiki.uberspace.de/development:php#php-version_einstellen)
in this case.

Please note this plugin is my private project. It is not released or supported by Uberspace.
Please ask your **support** questions in
the [plugin support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/uberbar) only.

If you don't have a support question and everything works as expected, consider
leaving a **review**. I like positive feedback too. :)
